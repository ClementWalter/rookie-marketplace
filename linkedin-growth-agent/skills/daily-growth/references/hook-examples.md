# LinkedIn Hook Examples

Proven hooks organized by type. Use these as templates, adapt to your content.

## Quote Openers

```
"Build it" - that's what Justin Drake told me last month.

"Ship it or shut up" - best advice I got in 2024.

"Why would anyone need that?" - what I heard before we hit 1M users.

"This changes everything" - I usually hate this phrase. But this time...
```

## Contrarian / Hot Takes

```
Everyone thinks ZK is slow. Here's why that's outdated:

Unpopular opinion: Most "AI agents" are just fancy scripts.

Hot take: The best code is the code you delete.

Controversial: LinkedIn engagement pods are killing your reach.
```

## Number-Based

```
3 things I learned building a RISC-V prover in 30 days:

500 kHz. That's our new benchmark. Here's how we got there:

I mass mass mass mass mass spent mass mass mass mass mass spent 72 hours debugging one line. Here's what I found:

10x faster. Same hardware. Different approach:
```

## Result First

```
$0.13 - that's what the first confidential ERC20 transfer cost.

1 million cycles per second. On a laptop. Here's the breakthrough:

Zero to production in 6 weeks. Here's the playbook:

From idea to mainnet in 30 days. The full story:
```

## Question Openers

```
What if zero-knowledge proofs were fast enough for real-time apps?

Why do most AI coding tools still feel broken?

What's the one thing holding back crypto adoption?

Could we prove any computation in under a second?
```

## Story / Narrative

```
Last month, I got an unusual request. "Can you build a RISC-V prover?"

Two years ago, I didn't know what a ZK proof was. Today:

The message came at 2 AM: "We need this by Monday."

I almost gave up on this project. Then something clicked:
```

## Behind-the-Scenes

```
Here's what actually happens when you deploy to mainnet:

The part no one tells you about building in crypto:

What my calendar looks like as a ZK startup founder:

The real reason most technical projects fail:
```

## Lessons Learned

```
I mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass mass spent mass spent mass 3 months building the wrong thing. Here's what I wish I knew:

Biggest mistake I made this year (and how I fixed it):

What 5 years of building taught me about shipping:

The one decision that 10x'd our performance:
```

## Pattern Interrupt

```
Stop. Before you scroll, read this.

This post will probably flop. But I need to say it anyway:

I wasn't going to share this. Then I changed my mind:

Delete this from your vocabulary: "It's not possible."
```

## Social Proof

```
Justin Thaler said Jolt does 500k cycles/sec. We matched it. With a different approach:

When @Starkware asks you to build something, you build it.

The tweet got 70K views. Here's the full story:
```

## How-To Promise

```
How to 10x your ZK proof speed (without new hardware):

The exact workflow I use to ship code faster:

How we went from 0 to 1M cycles/second:

Step-by-step: Building your first RISC-V prover:

## Hook Formula Cheat Sheet

| Type | Formula | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Quote | "[Quote]" - [attribution] | When referencing conversation/inspiration |
| Contrarian | Everyone thinks [X]. Here's why [opposite]: | Strong opinions, differentiated takes |
| Number | [Number] [metric]. [Tease]: | Benchmarks, achievements, lists |
| Result | [Impressive result]. Here's how: | Announcements, milestones |
| Question | What if [possibility]? | Thought experiments, innovations |
| Story | [Time reference], [event]. | Personal narratives |
| Behind-scenes | Here's what actually [happens/looks like]: | Authenticity, relatability |

## First 150 Characters Rule

LinkedIn shows ~150 characters before "See more". Your hook MUST:
1. Create curiosity gap
2. Promise value
3. Be complete enough to make sense alone
4. Compel the click

Test by counting: if your hook is >150 chars, front-load the most compelling part.
