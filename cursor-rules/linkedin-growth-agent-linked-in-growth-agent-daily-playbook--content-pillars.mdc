# Content Pillars

_Reference for LinkedIn Growth Agent - Daily Playbook skill (linkedin-growth-agent plugin)_

# Content Pillars - Detailed Guidelines

## Pillar 1: ZK/Cryptography (40% of content)

### Topics
- RISC-V provers and VM proving
- Stwo proving system (Starkware)
- FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)
- Starknet ecosystem
- Zero-knowledge proof benchmarks
- Cairo language and tooling

### Angle for LinkedIn
- Focus on "why it matters" beyond crypto natives
- Benchmark comparisons (speed, cost, efficiency)
- Real-world applications enabled
- Technical breakthroughs explained simply

### Example Adaptations

**Twitter (technical):**
> NEW RISC-V rv32im prover reaching 500khz on M2 Max

**LinkedIn (accessible):**
```
500,000 operations per second. On a laptop.

That's our new RISC-V prover benchmark.

Why this matters beyond crypto:
→ Proves any computation happened correctly
→ Without revealing the actual data
→ Fast enough for real applications now

We're using Starkware's Stwo system. The architecture that makes this possible: [technical detail]

What applications would you build if you could prove computation this fast?


```

### Keywords to Include
- Zero-knowledge, ZK proofs
- Verifiable computation
- Cryptographic proving
- Privacy-preserving
- Trustless verification

## Pillar 2: AI/Agents (30% of content)

### Topics
- Claude Code and AI coding assistants
- Agentic workflows and automation
- Scaling AI agent teams
- AI + crypto intersection
- Developer productivity with AI

### Angle for LinkedIn
- Practical productivity gains
- How-to and workflows
- Team/organizational implications
- Hot takes on AI hype vs reality

### Example Adaptations

**Twitter:**
> hot take of the agentic world: scaling teams of agent is no different from scaling team of humans

**LinkedIn:**
```
Hot take: Scaling AI agents = scaling human teams.

After weeks of building with Claude Code, here's what I've learned:

1. Quantified planning matters
   → Agents need clear scope like humans need sprint planning

2. Continuous improvement is mandatory
   → Review agent outputs, refine prompts, iterate

3. Someone needs to be the PO
   → You're the boss. Agents need direction.

The "Chief of Staff" pattern: one orchestrator agent managing specialized workers.

Same management principles. Different workers.

How are you organizing your AI workflows?


```

### Keywords to Include
- AI agents, agentic workflows
- Claude Code, AI coding
- Developer productivity
- Automation, orchestration
- Human-AI collaboration

## Pillar 3: Founder Journey (20% of content)

### Topics
- Kakarot zkEVM updates
- Zama (FHE company) milestones
- Building in public
- Startup challenges and wins
- Web3 ecosystem observations

### Angle for LinkedIn
- Authentic founder experiences
- Milestones and announcements
- Lessons learned
- Team and culture

### Example Adaptations

**Twitter:**
> The first ever confidential ERC20 transfer on L1 has been done and it costed only about 0.13$

**LinkedIn:**
```
$0.13

That's what the first confidential ERC20 transfer on Ethereum mainnet cost.

Yesterday, Zama Protocol went live. We completed the first confidential stablecoin (cUSDT) transfer.

What this means:
→ Private transactions on public chains
→ Compliance-friendly confidentiality
→ At costs that actually make sense

Two years of building FHE infrastructure. One transaction to prove it works.

This is just the beginning.

### Keywords to Include
- Building in public
- Startup journey
- Web3, crypto infrastructure
- zkEVM, rollups
- Blockchain scalability

## Pillar 4: Hot Takes (10% of content)

### Topics
- Industry predictions
- Contrarian opinions
- Calling out BS
- Unpopular truths

### Angle for LinkedIn
- Thoughtful contrarianism (not edgy for edgy's sake)
- Backed by experience/data
- Invites discussion
- Professional but direct

### Guidelines
- Use sparingly (1x every 2 weeks max)
- Must be defensible
- Should spark genuine debate
- Avoid attacking individuals

### Example Format
```
Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take]

Here's why I believe this:
→ [Evidence 1]
→ [Evidence 2]
→ [Evidence 3]

I could be wrong. But after [experience], this is where I land.

Change my mind?

## Content Mix by Day

| Day | Primary Pillar | Reasoning |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| Tuesday | ZK/Crypto or AI | Start week strong with expertise |
| Wednesday | Founder Journey or repurposed banger | Mid-week engagement |
| Thursday | Hot Take or AI | End-of-week reflection |

## Cross-Pillar Opportunities

Some topics span multiple pillars - these often perform best:

- "How I used Claude Code to build a ZK prover" (AI + ZK)
- "Lessons from scaling Kakarot's AI-assisted development" (Founder + AI)
- "Why FHE + ZK is the future of blockchain privacy" (ZK + Founder)

Look for these intersections when selecting content to cross-post.
