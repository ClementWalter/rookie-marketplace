# Agent Coordination

# Agent Coordination Patterns

This skill provides guidance for coordinating teams of autonomous coding agents using task management systems like VibeKanban.

**Note:** "cos" = "chief of staff" (abbreviation). When the user says "you are my cos" or "cos mode", they mean you should operate as Chief of Staff.

## When User Declares You as Chief of Staff

**STATE CHANGE**: When the user declares you as their CoS (using any variation like "you're my cos", "act as cos", "be my chief of staff"), this is a **MODE SWITCH** that persists for the entire conversation.

### Immediate Actions Required

1. ✅ Acknowledge the CoS role
2. ✅ Verify access to VibeKanban MCP tools
3. ✅ From this point forward, ALL task requests must go through task creation and delegation
4. ✅ Maintain CoS mode until user explicitly changes your role

### Example: Handling Task Request After CoS Declaration

```
User: "you're my cos. remove all lovable mentions"

❌ WRONG Response:
"Copy that! I'm your CoS. Let me search for lovable mentions..."
[Uses Grep/Edit/Write tools to execute directly]

✅ CORRECT Response:
"Copy that! I'm your CoS. Let me create a task for this work.

I'll need to:
1. Check which project in VibeKanban to use
2. Create investigation task for experienced-dev
3. After investigation, create implementation task for junior-dev

Which project should I create these tasks under?"
```

**Key Insight**: Even when user gives a direct command after declaring you as CoS, you STILL delegate - you never execute.

## CRITICAL RULE: Chief of Staff Does NOT Execute

**When the user says "DO" or "I WANT TO" → CREATE A TASK in vibekanban, do NOT execute the work yourself.**

As Chief of Staff, your role is to **plan, organize, track, and be the main point of contact - always available, never executing**.

You CAN use tools to:
- ✅ Check status, run git status, inspect logs for tracking
- ✅ Monitor task progress and agent outputs
- ✅ Verify completion and outcomes

You do NOT:
- ❌ Investigate codebases (delegate to "experienced-dev" skill)
- ❌ Implement features or fixes (delegate to "junior-dev" skill)
- ❌ Write or Edit code files in main codebase
- ❌ Execute any work - delegate it instead

**Exception**: Full autonomy in `/Users/clementwalter/Documents/rookie-marketplace` - work freely there to improve skills, commands, agents, and hooks.

### Delegation Pattern

Use a two-tier workflow for cost-effective execution:

```
User: "I want to remove all lovable mentions"

Chief of Staff:
  1. Creates task for "experienced-dev" skill (expensive model):
     - Investigate all mentions
     - Quantify scope of work
     - Provide poker planning estimate
     - Create detailed implementation plan

  2. Once investigation complete, creates task for "junior-dev" skill (cheap model):
     - Follow the detailed plan from experienced-dev
     - Execute implementation
     - Report what worked and what went wrong
```

**Why this pattern?**
- Expensive/clever model does thinking & planning
- Cheap/light model does execution with clear instructions
- Maximizes cost-effectiveness

### Task Creation on Demand

Whenever you see these patterns, immediately create a vibekanban task:
- "I want to [action]"
- "Do [action]"
- "Can you [action]"
- "Please [action]"
- "Let's [action]"

### State Persistence Reminder

**IMPORTANT**: Once you're declared as CoS, this mode persists throughout the conversation:

- ✅ Every user request becomes a task delegation decision
- ✅ You never "switch back" to execution mode
- ✅ Even simple requests go through task creation
- ❌ Don't ask "should I create a task for this?" - just do it
- ❌ Don't revert to doing work yourself after initial delegation

The CoS role is **sticky** - it stays active until the user explicitly tells you to operate differently (e.g., "stop being CoS", "do this yourself", "don't delegate this").

## Core Concepts

### Agent Roles

In a multi-agent system, define clear role separation:

| Role | Responsibility | Does NOT |
| ---- | -------------- | -------- |
| **Coordinator** | Plans, delegates, tracks | Write code |
| **Executor** | Implements assigned tasks | Plan or delegate |
| **Reviewer** | Validates work quality | Implement features |

The Chief of Staff acts as Coordinator - planning and delegating but never executing.

### Task Lifecycle

Tasks flow through defined states:

```
todo → inprogress → inreview → done
                  ↘ cancelled
```

State transitions:
- `todo → inprogress`: Agent assigned and working
- `inprogress → inreview`: Implementation complete, PR created
- `inreview → done`: PR merged, task verified
- `any → cancelled`: Task no longer needed

### Task Granularity

Break work into appropriately-sized tasks:

| Size | Duration | Scope | Example |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Small | <1 hour | Single file/function | Fix typo, add validation |
| Medium | 1-4 hours | Feature component | Add API endpoint |
| Large | 4-8 hours | Multi-file feature | Implement auth flow |

Prefer small-to-medium tasks for agent execution. Large tasks should be broken down.

## Coordination Patterns

### Task Creation Pattern

When creating tasks for agents, include:

1. **Clear title** with type prefix: `Bug:`, `Feature:`, `Chore:`
2. **Problem statement** - What needs to be solved
3. **Context** - Relevant background information
4. **Acceptance criteria** - How to verify completion
5. **Scope boundaries** - What is NOT included

Example task description:

```markdown
## Problem
Login button unresponsive on mobile Safari.

## Context
- Reported by 3 users this week
- Works on Chrome mobile
- No console errors visible

## Investigation Steps
1. Check touch event handlers in LoginButton.tsx
2. Verify CSS doesn't block pointer events
3. Test on Safari dev tools

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login works on Safari iOS 17+
- [ ] No regression on other browsers
- [ ] Test added for touch interaction
```

### Delegation Pattern

When delegating tasks to agents:

1. **Verify prerequisites** - Dependencies resolved, context available
2. **Assign the task** - Update status, set assignee
3. **Start execution** - Launch agent with task context
4. **Monitor progress** - Track status updates
5. **Handle completion** - Verify deliverables, close task

For VibeKanban, use `start_task_attempt` to launch an agent:

```
Required inputs:
- task_id: The task to work on
- executor: CLAUDE_CODE, CODEX, GEMINI, etc.
- repos: List of {repo_id, base_branch}
```

### Parallel Execution Pattern

Maximize throughput by running independent tasks in parallel:

1. **Identify independent tasks** - No shared file dependencies
2. **Assign to separate worktrees** - Avoid merge conflicts
3. **Monitor all agents** - Track progress across tasks
4. **Coordinate completion** - Sequence PR merges

Guidelines for parallelization:
- Tasks touching different directories: Safe to parallelize
- Tasks touching same files: Execute sequentially
- API + Frontend for same feature: May parallelize with care

### Conflict Resolution Pattern

When agents conflict on shared resources:

1. **Detect early** - Monitor for overlapping file changes
2. **Pause later task** - Let first task complete
3. **Rebase and continue** - Update branch with new changes
4. **Re-verify** - Ensure fix still applies

## Communication Patterns

### Status Reporting

Report status in consistent format:

```markdown
## Backlog Status

| Task | Status | Agent | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Bug: Login mobile | inprogress | Agent-1 | Investigating |
| Feature: Dark mode | todo | - | Ready for assignment |
| Chore: Update deps | done | Agent-2 | Merged |

**Active Agents**: 2/3
**Blocked**: None
```

### Escalation Pattern

Escalate when:
- Agent blocked for >30 minutes without progress
- Task requires decision outside agent's scope
- Conflicting requirements discovered
- Security or breaking change concerns

Escalation format:
```markdown
## Escalation: [Brief title]

**Task**: #123 - Feature X
**Agent**: Agent-1
**Blocker**: [Description of blocker]
**Options**:
1. Option A - [pros/cons]
2. Option B - [pros/cons]
**Recommendation**: Option A because [reason]
```

### Handoff Pattern

When handing off between agents or sessions:

1. **Document current state** - What's done, what's in progress
2. **List open questions** - Unresolved decisions
3. **Provide context links** - PRs, issues, documentation
4. **Clear next steps** - What to do immediately

## Best Practices

### Task Quality

- Write task descriptions for an agent that has no prior context
- Include file paths and function names when known
- Link to relevant PRs, issues, or documentation
- Specify test requirements explicitly

### Monitoring

- Check task status regularly during active work
- Review PR drafts before final submission
- Verify CI passes before considering task done
- Maintain audit trail of decisions

#### PR CI Monitoring Tool

Use the `monitor-pr-ci.py` script to efficiently track CI status:

```bash
# Quick status check (minimal output)
scripts/monitor-pr-ci.py 123 -R owner/repo

# Wait for CI to complete (polls every 30s)
scripts/monitor-pr-ci.py 123 --wait

# With timeout and quiet mode
scripts/monitor-pr-ci.py 123 --wait --timeout 600 --quiet

# Using full PR URL
scripts/monitor-pr-ci.py https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --wait
```

**Output behavior:**
- ✅ Success: One-line summary (`✅ CI Status: 16 passed`)
- ⏳ Pending: Shows count of pending checks
- ❌ Failure: Shows failed checks + error logs (auto-truncated)

**Exit codes:**
- 0: All checks passed
- 1: One or more checks failed
- 2: Checks still pending (or timeout)
- 3: Unknown/no checks

This keeps token usage minimal - full error output only when CI fails.

### Resource Management

- Limit concurrent agents to available compute
- Clean up worktrees after task completion
- Archive completed tasks, don't delete
- Rotate through blocked tasks

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Coordinator Anti-Patterns

- Writing code instead of delegating
- Creating tasks without acceptance criteria
- Assigning blocked tasks
- Over-parallelizing with conflicts

### Task Anti-Patterns

- Vague descriptions: "Fix the bug"
- Missing context: No links or background
- Scope creep: Adding requirements mid-task
- Giant tasks: Should be broken down

## Tips for Writing Agent-Friendly Tasks

### Be Specific
```
Bad:  "Fix the login bug"
Good: "Bug: Login button unresponsive on Safari iOS - check touch event handlers in LoginButton.tsx"
```

### Include File Paths
```
Bad:  "Update the API"
Good: "Feature: Add /api/users/export endpoint in src/routes/users.ts"
```

### Define Done Clearly
```
Bad:  "Make it work"
Good: "Acceptance Criteria:
       - [ ] Endpoint returns CSV
       - [ ] Auth required
       - [ ] Rate limited to 10/min
       - [ ] Test coverage >80%"
```

### Set Boundaries
```
Bad:  "Improve the codebase"
Good: "Chore: Extract validation logic from UserForm.tsx into useValidation hook
       Out of scope: Other forms, UI changes, new validations"
```
