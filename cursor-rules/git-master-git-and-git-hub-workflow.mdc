# Git & GitHub Workflow

# Git & GitHub Workflow Patterns

Complete guidance for Git operations (commits, branches, worktrees) and GitHub workflows (issues, PRs, milestones).

## Git Worktree Workflow

**All coding work happens in git worktrees, never in the main working directory.**

### Worktree Location

```
~/.claude/worktrees/
└── <repo-name>/
    ├── <task-slug-1>/
    └── <task-slug-2>/
```

### Create Worktree

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/worktrees/$(basename $(pwd))
git worktree add ~/.claude/worktrees/$(basename $(pwd))/<task-slug> -b <branch-name>
cd ~/.claude/worktrees/$(basename $(pwd))/<task-slug>
```

### Merge Worktrees

Use `/merge` command to merge all worktree changes back to main with AI-generated commit.

## GitHub Issue Management

### Issue Hierarchy

GitHub supports hierarchical organization through sub-issues (tasklists):

```
Epic Issue (Milestone-level)
├── Feature Issue (Parent)
│   ├── Sub-issue 1 (Implementation task)
│   └── Sub-issue 2 (Implementation task)
└── Feature Issue (Parent)
    └── Sub-issues...
```

Create sub-issues using tasklist syntax in parent issue body:

```markdown
## Tasks
- [ ] #123
- [ ] #124
```

### Milestone Strategy

Milestones represent time-boxed delivery targets:

| Type | Duration | Purpose |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Sprint | 1-2 weeks | Specific deliverables |
| Release | 1-3 months | Version targets |
| Division | Varies | Team/domain groupings |

### Issue Labels

| Label Type | Examples |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Priority | `P0-critical`, `P1-high`, `P2-medium` |
| Type | `bug`, `feature`, `chore`, `docs` |
| Status | `needs-triage`, `blocked`, `ready` |
| Area | `frontend`, `api`, `infra` |

---

## Workflow Procedures

### Creating Issues

Use Why/What/How structure:

```markdown
## Why
[Problem statement - what need does this address?]

## What
[Solution description - what will be built?]

## How
[Implementation approach]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

### Committing Changes

Follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Key rules:
- Never commit to main directly
- Run linter before committing: `trunk check --ci --fix`
- Use present tense imperative: "add" not "added"

### Creating Pull Requests

1. Commit all changes
2. Sync with main: `git rebase origin/main`
3. Generate summary from diff
4. Link to issue: `Closes #<number>`
5. Create or update PR

### Autonomous Issue Resolution

For parallel issue work:

1. Fetch unassigned issues
2. Self-assign to claim
3. Create worktree: `git worktree add -b fix/issue-<n> ~/.claude/worktrees/<repo>/issue-<n> main`
4. Implement, test, commit
5. Create PR and report

---

## Utility Scripts

Execute milestone and issue operations with these uv scripts:

| Script | Usage |
| ------ | ----- |
| `set_milestone_recursive.py` | Set milestone on all sub-issues recursively |
| `milestone_from_issues.py` | Convert issues into new milestones |
| `division_to_milestones.py` | Convert Division-labeled issues to milestones |
| `move_subissues.py` | Move sub-issues between parent issues |

Run scripts with `--dry-run` first:

```bash
uv run scripts/set_milestone_recursive.py <milestone_url> --dry-run
uv run scripts/milestone_from_issues.py <milestone_url> --dry-run
uv run scripts/move_subissues.py <source_url> <target_url> --dry-run
```

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `/merge` | Merge all worktree changes back to main branch |

## Examples

### Issue Template

# Issue Template: Why/What/How Structure

Use this template when creating GitHub issues for clear communication.

---

## Bug Report Template

```markdown
## Why

[Describe the problem and its impact]

- What is broken or not working as expected?
- How does this affect users/developers?
- What is the expected behavior?

## What

[Describe what needs to be fixed]

- Specific component or feature affected
- Scope of the fix

## How

[Technical approach to fix]

1. Step 1: Investigate root cause
2. Step 2: Implement fix
3. Step 3: Add regression test

## Reproduction Steps

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. See error

## Environment

- OS: [e.g., macOS 14.0]
- Browser: [e.g., Chrome 120]
- Version: [e.g., v1.2.3]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bug no longer reproducible
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] No new warnings in logs
```

---

## Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Why

[Problem statement or opportunity]

- What user need does this address?
- What is the current pain point?
- What value does this provide?

## What

- Non-goals (what this is NOT)

## How

[Implementation approach]

### Technical Design

1. Component A changes

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are available in the marketplace but cannot be executed from Cursor rules:

- `division_to_milestones.py`: Convert issues with "Division" label from a milestone into milestones in the same repo.
- `set_milestone_recursive.py`: Recursively set milestone on all sub-issues for milestones in a repository.
- `move_subissues.py`: Move all sub-issues from one parent issue to another and optionally add labels.
- `milestone_from_issues.py`: Convert issues from a milestone into milestones, migrating their sub-issues.

To use these scripts, run them via `uv run` from the marketplace directory.
